- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RoroLeBarjo
I am currently working on a trading bit that would use statistical evidence to trade in a mechanical manner.

Since 3 months I have designed more than 30 different strategy based on statistical model and try them out on live futures trading on binance.

I am looking to other enthusiastic people to share idea on this fabulous topic! Do not hesitate to contact me.
